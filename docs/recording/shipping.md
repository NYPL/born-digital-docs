## Shipping Hard Drives
When you are unable to send files via Google Drive you can ship a hard drive with completed packages to NYPL. See [How to Bag](){:target="_blank"}.
* Complete any [preview process]() needed with the curator/manager before sending files.
* Contact [Digital Preservation](mailto:digitalarchives@nypl.org) and the curator/manager you are working with to confirm that you will be shipping a hard drive.
* Choose a carrier like UPS or FedEX. Ask if you would like to use another carrier.
* Include shipping charges in your invoice.
* Place the hard drive in a box with packing material so that the hard drive fits snuggly. 
* Create a shipping label and return label.
    * Place the return label in the box with the drive.
    * Address the package to LSC. Digital Preservation staff will send the address when you email.
* Arrange for carrier pick up or drop off.
* Digital Preservation will ship the drive back using the enclosed return label.
