## Introduction

These instructions assume you are comfortable with command-line interfaces such as Terminal and package managers like `pip` and `homebrew`.

If you are not familiar with command-line interfaces, we strongly recommend using [Bagger](install-bagger.html) instead of bagit-python. If you are familiar with command-line interfaces, you may prefer bagit-python to Bagger.

The following instructions can be used for Mac, Linux, and Windows computers, unless otherwise noted.
