# For videographers and recordists

This section is primarily written for those recording audio or video for the NYPL projects named in the [about page](../../){:target="_blank"}. It includes pages on file/folder specifications, how to create bags, and how to submit files to NYPL.

The specifications and processes have been written to accommodate a variety of scenarios. Once your project is running, you will likely use a subset of the information in this section that is relevant to your specific project. If you have any questions, please [contact us](mailto:digitalarchives@nypl.org) and the curator you are working with.

## Checklist for videographers and recordists
