## Previewing Submissions

Some programs ask to review the edited versions of programs before they are submitted. If you do not have a separate workflow established with the curator of the program, please use the following process.

## Review Process

* Upload the service copy version of the recording to the `_Files_for_Review` folder within your program's Google Drive
  * [Dance Oral History](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AGEqr40j8r-tUk9PVA)
  * [Dance OriginalDocumentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AMC0rSYAhPFYUk9PVA)
  * [NYC Trans Oral History](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AITNOg-_vrbaUk9PVA)
  * [Theatre on Film and Tape](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0AD02PGgGZHqoUk9PVA)
* Notify the curator that the files are available to review
* If changes are requested, upload a new version with a version marked at the end of the file name. This version number does not need to be added to the final copy.
* After the curator approves the edit, bag the project

## File Retention

All files in the preview folder are deleted 60 days after upload.
