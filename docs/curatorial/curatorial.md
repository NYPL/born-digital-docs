# Curatorial staff
This section contains information for curatorial staff sending completed packages to Preservation. The instructions in this section can be completed per batch when large numbers of packages are sent at one time. In this section of the site you will find instructions for filling out the metadata spreadsheet to be included with completed batches of packages. This section is most useful just before packages are sent to Preservation.
